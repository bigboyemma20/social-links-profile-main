## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

While building this project, I learned how to:

- Correctly set up a responsive card layout using Flexbox.

- Work with CSS custom properties to maintain consistent colors throughout the project.

- Improve button interactivity with :hover and :active states.

- Structure a simple, clean, mobile-first design.

Hereâ€™s an example of using CSS custom properties and button styles:


```css
:root{
    --Green: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --Grey-700: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    --Grey-800: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    --Grey-900: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
}

button:active{
    background-color: var(--Green);
    color: var(--Grey-900);
    font-weight: 700;
    cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
    background-color: var(--Green);
    color: var(--Grey-900);
    cursor: pointer;
  }
```


### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Practice adding smooth transitions to hover states for even better UX.

- Experiment with adding animations to page elements.

- Learn more about accessibility best practices, like improving focus states and using ARIA labels.
