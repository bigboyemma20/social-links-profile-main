## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design (Mobile-first workflow)

### What I learned

While working on this project, I improved my understanding of CSS transitions, hover/focus/active states, and how to use media queries for mobile responsiveness.

### Continued development

I would like to continue improving in advanced responsive techniques (like CSS Grid and more complex Flexbox layouts) and adding accessibility best practices.
